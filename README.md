Presentation at FOSS4G-NA 2018: https://2018.foss4g-na.org/session/contributing-every-day-how-i-made-career-working-osm

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. It is being recognized as a useful dataset for training machine learning algorithms, deriving analytics on mapping behaviors, providing vital datasets to first responders to natural disasters, and a casual place for geonerds to continue to contribute to a living map of the world.

At Radiant Solutions, we are using OpenStreetMap on a number of different efforts, and are organizing a panel session where we, along with some of our partners in the Open Source Community (including but not limited to Azavea, Development Seed, and/or Terranodo) to discuss and answer questions about how we use OSM each and every day to support the open source community.

Panel participants are Kate Chapman, Rob Emanuele, Josh Campbell, and Drew Bollinger.
