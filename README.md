Hootenanny (www.github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny) is an open-source software suite that supports the conflation, translation, and export of vector data. Radiant Solutions has developed this software for over 7 years, but the decision was made to open source it in 2015 in coordination with the USG. This talk will detail the benefits we have found by working in the open, including open source contributions, enabling a distributed workforce, and utilizing technologies that may have been unavailable if we were not in the GitHub and open source ecosystem. Participants of this talk should be those that are interested in open sourcing their software, those that work with agencies and companies that may be resistant to open source software, and those that are interested to hear what developers think about working in GitHub.
